## Add cypress to your own project
If you have a side project or school project (ongoing or from earlier) you can try to create a cypress test for that project. You can install cypress in that project or you can just reuse the cypress setup from this course. If your website is not hosted on an url, you can start it locally and run your cypress tests against your local dev environment. For the first test, try to do test something simple. Then try to make an end-to-end test that tests the happy path through your app. An example of a happy path could be buying the simplest product in an online store.

**Tip** If you find that your application does not have any good selectors, then add the selectors you need. This is not cheating, cypress tests should be developed alongside the application you want to test.
