# Test automation with Cypress

Welcome to our test automation workshop! During this course you will learn the advantages of using Cypress, fundamental concepts and commands, and the value of test automation with regards to its coverage, response time, and efficiency.  By the end of this evening, we hope you attained both skill and knowledge on how you can properly test any web pages using automation with the Cypress framework. 

## Prerequisites 
Before we start working with Cypress, we'll need to have two things in place: 
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 10 or higher)
- An IDE
- Go through our [Windows](https://github.com/Itera/cypress-kurs-navet-2021/tree/main/Windows%20Installation%20Guide) or [Mac](https://github.com/Itera/cypress-kurs-navet-2021/tree/main/Mac%20Installation%20Guide) installation guide (TODO: legg inn link og få installasjonsguidene over på .md)

## Ensure the test runner is working as intended
In a command prompt, navigate to your Cypress folder and type in **npx cypress open**. The Cypress test runner will - after a while - pop up. Ensure that you see example files under the 'examples' folder and that you're able to execute Cypress by clicking on one of them, a new browser window should pop up with the message that the windows is being controlled by software for automated testing. The test-suite should then start running.
